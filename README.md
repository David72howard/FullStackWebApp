# usCampgrounds

### Task 
I am following along with an online coding bootcamp in creating this web application to learn fullstack web development. 

### Functionality 
This web application allows users to create and delete campgrounds as well as create and delete reviews for campgrounds.
### Design 
This project is designed to have a similar feel to yelp's website. 
### Run Locally 
//$ git clone https://github.com/David72howard/FullStackWebDev.git

//$ npm install

//$ node app.js

Have fun exploring the web app!
